## HEAR-Net Pytorch Implementation

Package & module dependencies will be updated.

First step : Implement end-to-end HEAR-Net pytorch code (ongoing)
- Model (ongoing)
- Train
- Inference

Second step : Get the best pretrained model

Third step : Verify if the output is the same to what we wanted

Last step : Integrate AEI-Net and HEAR-Net into the full-pipeline model.
